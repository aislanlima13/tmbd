## Introduction

This project serves as a practical study of clean architecture and clean code concepts by implementing a movie and series listing application. The application fetches data from the TMDB API to display information about movies, series, and actors.

## Features

- List popular movies
- List popular TV series
- List popular actors

## Future Features
- Search for movies, series, and actors
- Display detailed information about a specific movie, series, or actor

## Architecture

The project follows the principles of clean architecture to ensure a separation of concerns and maintainability. Key components include:

- **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI-related code, including activities, fragments, and view models.
- **Domain Layer**: Holds business logic and use cases independent of the UI.
- **Data Layer**: Manages data retrieval and storage, interacting with external APIs (TMDB API in this case).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-series-listing.git

## Usage
Explore the app and learn about clean architecture and clean code principles in action. The UI provides an intuitive way to navigate and search for movies, series, and actors.
